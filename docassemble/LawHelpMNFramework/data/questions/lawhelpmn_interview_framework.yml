################################ ORG LEVEL VARIABLES #################################
# These blocks define Assembly Line-level variables that will most likely be consistent throughout the portfolio. Add to individual interviews as needed.
code: |
  AL_DEFAULT_COUNTRY = "US" # default country and list of states in address fields
---
code: |
  AL_DEFAULT_STATE = "MN"     # default state in address fields
---
code: |
  AL_ORGANIZATION_HOMEPAGE = get_config('app homepage', 'https://www.lawhelpmn.org/forms')    # Used to set the exit url that you will be taken to if you click the title in the navigation bar.
---
code: |
  AL_ORGANIZATION_TITLE = "LawHelpMN"   # Used to set the organization title (which appears above the interview title) in the navigation bar. 
  
#  Add this to the interview code when the header still shows "Minnesota Court Forms Online". This should be overriding in the config file to be "LawHelpMN", but it appears that this is not always the case. This can be overridden in the individual interview files by applying this code block. 
---
code: |
  AL_DEFAULT_OVERFLOW_MESSAGE = " [CONTINUED ON ATTACHMENT.]"  # Used to control the text displayed in an input box when text is too long to fit on a PDF. The default is ... if not specified.

  Welcome to the ${ LawHelpMN_interview_short_title } interview.

  This interview will help you prepare your ${ LawHelpMN_form_type } and give you next steps.  

  This interview does not give legal advice. Using this program does not mean you have an attorney-client relationship.

  You alone are responsible for the outcome of your case. If you need legal advice, you should contact a lawyer. Find [your local legal aid provider](https://www.lsc.gov/what-legal-aid/find-legal-aid).
